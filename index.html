			 <p>I&rsquo;m a very picky person when it comes to buying things‚Ä¶¬†especially Apple hardware. I can&rsquo;t count the number of Apple devices I tried out and sent back, because something wasn&rsquo;t right. Because there are always tradeoffs, and I don&rsquo;t like tradeoffs, I want it to be just perfect üòÖ</p>
<p>So since I really needed a new MacBook (I&rsquo;ve been using an M1, which would be fine if I had only bought it with more than 8 GB RAM‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), last autumn I decided to test MacBooks this way. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted an Air or a Pro, since they&rsquo;re quite different right now. There&rsquo;s this <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/apples-extended-return-policy-2024/">holiday promotion</a> that Apple has each year around Black Friday, that if you buy something in November-December, you can safely return it until the 2nd week of January (!) instead of the usual 2-week period. So I decided to buy both an M3 13&quot; Air and an M4 14&quot; Pro, try them out and pick one to keep in January üôÉ</p>
<p>Spoiler: I&rsquo;ve kept the Air in the end. The Pro has some things better than the Air, but it&rsquo;s noticeably thicker and heavier, and using the classic MacBook Airs for ~5 years in the last decade has spoiled me forever, and I just refuse to go back to heavier, bulkier laptops.</p>
<p>There are a few more differences that I wrote down, so here&rsquo;s a short subjective comparison if you&rsquo;re just looking at those shiny new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/">Sky Blue Airs</a> and thinking if you should get that one or the Pro‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Note: I haven&rsquo;t really used the Pro that much, certainly not all the time for 2 months ‚Äì more like a few times for a few hours. I&rsquo;m writing on the Air right now.</p>
<h3 id="size--exterior">Size / exterior</h3>
<p>As mentioned, there is definitely a difference. For comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>current MacBook Air 13.6&quot; (2025): 1.24 kg</li>
<li>Retina MacBook Air 13.3&quot; (2020): 1.29 kg</li>
<li>classic MacBook Air 13.3&quot; (2015): 1.35 kg</li>
<li>older MacBook Pro 13.3&quot; (2020): 1.40 kg</li>
<li>current MacBook Pro 14.2&quot; (2024): 1.55 kg (M4) to 1.62 kg (M4 Max)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the lightest Pro is 150g heavier than my previous M1, 200g heavier than classic MacBook Airs, and 300g+ heavier than the current Air (!). That&rsquo;s about 2/3 of the iPad&rsquo;s weight of difference, and it&rsquo;s absolutely noticeable. It might not be a problem if you use it as a desktop computer, but it is a problem if you need to carry it around all the time, or if you have the &ldquo;on the lap lying on the couch&rdquo; kind of workplace like me‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The Pro is also a lot thicker (and at least feels thicker than the 13.3&quot; Pro). It&rsquo;s not that much of a problem, but I definitely like how super thin the Air is.</p>
<p>I remember the Pro also had those kinda annoying slots with a bit sharp edges at the bottom, for air in/outflow probably, Air doesn&rsquo;t have those.</p>
<h3 id="screen">Screen</h3>
<p>The Pro has a slightly bigger screen, not that much though.</p>
<p><strong>ProMotion</strong> (120 Hz) on the Pro is immediately noticeable, but I can&rsquo;t say if it&rsquo;s important or even clearly better, it&rsquo;s a bit weird at first (feels kinda‚Ä¶ iOS-y?); probably something I could get used to rather quickly though. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m missing it on the Air at all, but I&rsquo;m not <em>that</em> used to this mode, since the only devices with it that I owned was my previous and current iPad.</p>
<p>The Pro has a better <strong>DPI</strong> ‚Äì the screen has a &ldquo;full 2x Retina&rdquo; resolution (1512 x 982 &ldquo;point&rdquo; size), while the Air uses a scaled resolution (1280 x 832 &ldquo;point&rdquo; size, while the standard display resolution is 1470 x 956), so the Pro&rsquo;s screen is sharper. Again, the past two MacBooks I&rsquo;ve used also used the scaled resolution, so it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s bothering me.</p>
<p>Pro has an <strong>HDR mode</strong> with higher brightness ‚Äì I&rsquo;ve tested this playing &ldquo;Silo&rdquo; on Apple TV, but‚Ä¶ I had a bit mixed feelings about it. I&rsquo;m not sure if it looked better on the Pro with the higher contrast and real black, than on the Air with less black blacks. And the white interface elements that show up on hover were kinda blinding.</p>
<p>The Pro is technically capable of higher peak <strong>SDR brightness</strong>, but it&rsquo;s hard to say how this works exactly ‚Äì the specs say &ldquo;up to 1000 nits (outdoor)&rdquo; (vs. Air&rsquo;s 500 nits). But note the &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; ‚Äì so it&rsquo;s something that uses the light sensor, and only enables higher max limit if it&rsquo;s in a bright place. So if you took both of them outside on a bright day, the Pro would probably be much more usable, but in a rather dark room, they looked pretty much the same at max brightness. But there might be some hacks to unlock the limit (?). Anyway, as someone who usually has max brightness set, and has sent back one Air in the past because it was too dark (400 nits), the current Air is good enough for me.</p>
<p>I was a bit worried about the screen <strong>color balance</strong> ‚Äì Apple has this annoying thing where every device has a <em>slightly</em> different white tone, sometimes it&rsquo;s more yellowish, sometimes more blueish, sometimes more towards violet‚Ä¶. and it&rsquo;s not always possible/easy to calibrate it differently. Some of the past MacBook Airs and the new OLED iPads are too yellowish for me, for example.</p>
<p>So these two‚Ä¶ are both kinda yellowish, the Pro even more so I think. But they can be calibrated a bit ‚Äì the Pro has this <a href="https://journal.mackuba.eu/uploads/2025/screenshot-2024-12-16-at-19.27.11.png">more advanced color calibration thingie</a> that I&rsquo;ve never seen before, that&rsquo;s missing on the Air, which lets you change color balance on a hexagonal grid. The Air has a standard color profile wizard with a white point slider. But I&rsquo;ve moved it <em>slightly</em> towards the blue and it&rsquo;s ok. If you&rsquo;re used to Apple&rsquo;s current OLED screens (I&rsquo;m not), you won&rsquo;t notice this.</p>
<h3 id="notch">Notch</h3>
<p>I was horrified when they first announced the MacBook with a notch in the screen‚Ä¶ I was expecting this to be a big problem. It&rsquo;s not really a problem in practice, and I say this as a notch-hater. I know there&rsquo;s <a href="https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/say-no-to-notch/id1639306886?mt=12">some hack</a> that lets you run a smaller resolution, pushing the menu bar down and making the screen fully rectangular, at the cost of lost vertical space, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d want that ‚Äì those pixels definitely count. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is that the notch <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3lhk7xzg3k22x">swallows overflowing icons</a> from the menu bar, they just disappear if you have too many. I was recommended several tools that work around this in that thread, but I haven&rsquo;t tried any yet.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h3>
<p>I think both have fairly similar keyboards ‚Äì the good one that Apple switched back to from the terrible butterfly one. They both felt ok to write on.</p>
<p>However, they do <em>look</em> different ‚Äì the Air has the classic black keys on silver background design, while the Pro has black keys on‚Ä¶ black. I&rsquo;m not a fan of this, tbh ‚Äì the keys are much harder to see. They do have the backlight of course, but you kinda need to rely only on that.</p>
<h3 id="ports">Ports</h3>
<p>The Pro has an HDMI port and an SD card slot. I couldn&rsquo;t care less tbh ‚Äì I use these very rarely, and I got adapters. I prefer a thinner laptop instead.</p>
<p>The bigger difference is the extra USB-C port on the right, while the Air only has ports on the left ‚Äì that would be kinda useful, but oh well.</p>
<p>The Pro also has the headphone jack on the left instead of right, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that matters. It might be better this way tbh ‚Äì I think they used to be on the left long ago, and I liked that more?‚Ä¶</p>
<h3 id="temperature">Temperature</h3>
<p>The Air definitely runs a bit warmer at idle than the M1 MBP did (doesn&rsquo;t really fall below 40¬∞C when it&rsquo;s running), and gets warm quicker when doing something serious, and I don&rsquo;t really like this‚Ä¶ or even if the temperature of the CPU is the same, it <em>feels</em> warmer on the bottom, which matters when you&rsquo;re mostly holding it on the lap. I guess it might be because of the fan-less internal design, or just things are arranged differently inside somehow. Although I think the Pro was also slightly warmer than my M1. (I&rsquo;m curious how the new M4 Air will turn out in complete reviews‚Ä¶)</p>
<h3 id="sound">Sound</h3>
<p>The Pro had a better sound on the speakers ‚Äì not that the Air sounds bad, but the Pro definitely sounded better somehow (note, I&rsquo;m not an audiophile at all).</p>
<p>And surprisingly, the Air has a different sounding touchpad. I think the click sound is the same here as on the 2020 MacBook Air, and different than the current and last few generations of Pros ‚Äì the Pros have a kinda more &ldquo;metallic&rdquo; click sound, and the Airs' touchpad click is‚Ä¶ I don&rsquo;t know how to describe it, it&rsquo;s different. A slightly lower, more &ldquo;dull&rdquo; tone. I think I like the Air version more.</p>

			 <p>2024 was a pretty intense year for me in terms of coding‚Ä¶ and a pretty not-intense one for anything else ü´£ I was so completely absorbed with building my Bluesky-related projects. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to be able to work on things which are based on my own ideas and needs, which give me fun problems to solve, let me learn a lot, and which seem to be helping <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3lh5vqe5yjs2r">a lot of other people</a>.</p>
<p>I figured I could look back at this past year and make a summary of what I managed to build and do, since it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve done <a href="https://mackuba.eu/2024/03/27/march-projects-update/">one of those</a>. Yes, I know we&rsquo;re well into February already, I&rsquo;ve been procrastinating, sue me. (Also, we&rsquo;ve just had an anniversary of <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-06-2024-join-bluesky">Bluesky public launch</a> a few days ago, so that seems like a good excuse too.)</p>

<p>Bluefeeds is my internal codename for the Ruby project which runs my main server at <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu">blue.mackuba.eu</a>, which includes my feed service, the Handle Directory, statistics and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li>New feeds: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/atproto">ATProto feed</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/atproto-links">ATProto projects feed</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/kit">Kit feed üê±</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/newsmastodon">News From Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/teamlinks">Bluesky Team Links feed</a></li>
<li>The two Replies feeds: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/replies">Only Replies</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/follows-replies">Follows &amp; Replies</a>, which have gained a lot of popularity after the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3l2s5t6op2w2x">Following feed changes</a> in the summer, when the option to show all replies in Following was removed, and which are now my two feeds with the biggest traffic</li>
<li>A work-in-progress <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/hashtag">Hashtags feed</a> (for following hashtags, currently requires <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3lhahkr4n4c2y">running a Ruby script</a> to add tags)</li>
<li>Some continuous updates to existing feeds, like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/feed/linux">Linux feed</a>, where I&rsquo;ve recently had to fix the name &ldquo;RedHat&rdquo; appearing in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3lhcrmbsbuc2k">completely unrelated contexts</a> ü´†</li>
<li>The <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/directory/">Handle Directory</a>, listing handles grouped by top-level domain, a global list of most popular accounts with custom handles, and a ranking of independent PDSes</li>
<li>The <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/stats/">statistics page</a>, showing daily and weekly post stats, later also separately for bridged posts from Mastodon/Nostr and posts on independent PDSes
<ul>
<li>I also periodically post stats of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3lge5635azs2g">most popular languages on Bluesky</a> ‚Äì what % of posts are in which language, and how many users are there that regularly post in each</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The very unstyled <a href="https://blue.mackuba.eu/labellers/">labellers list page</a>, which was even briefly featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk1QyS0B_0&amp;t=625s">CNBC video</a> for a few seconds ü§Ø</li>
<li>An automatically updating list of official <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/lists/3lcq5ovmsjn2s">.gov</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/lists/3lcq7vydkgi27">.edu</a> accounts with verified handles, plus an open source repo with the <a href="https://github.com/mackuba/userlist_sync">script that updates them</a></li>
<li>I also managed to learn some basics of Rust ü¶Ä and to write ‚Äì with major help from ChatGPT ‚Äì a tiny native module for Ruby in Rust, which I knew absolutely nothing about before, to speed up the matching of post contents to regexps (I&rsquo;ll try to write a bit more about this at some point and share the code)</li>
<li>‚Ä¶ and I&rsquo;ve spent literally months working on migrating this whole thing from SQLite to <a href="https://journal.mackuba.eu/2025/01/16/postgress-progress/">either MySQL or Postgres</a>, and I&rsquo;m still not done üò©</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="skythreadhttpsgithubcommackubaskythread"><a href="https://github.com/mackuba/skythread">Skythread</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a hashtag feed view, listing latest posts with the given hashtag, back when this wasn&rsquo;t working in the Bluesky app yet</li>
<li>Similarly, added a post quotes counter and a view listing the post quotes, before that was added to the app (you can still use it now to peek at the quotes which are hidden/detached in the official app üòà)</li>
<li>Implemented link highlighting and link cards</li>
<li>Added special handling for bridged Mastodon posts, which are showing author&rsquo;s formatted Mastodon handle and the expanded full-length post contents (since Bridgy <a href="https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1092#issuecomment-2164027121">stashes the full original text</a> in a custom field in the post records)</li>
<li>Added an &ldquo;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3kxg32sjqi22x">infohazard</a>&rdquo; feature, which lets you load hidden comments which the official app hides because of the &ldquo;nuclear block&rdquo; between two commenters</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these, like the quotes list and the hidden comments, use data loaded from the Bluefeeds server APIs ‚Äì since I&rsquo;m saving all incoming posts to one big-ass table, I can index them by quote source and by thread root, and can use that to look up all quotes of a post or all replies which are supposed to be there in the thread.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oof‚Ä¶ that&rsquo;s a lot of stuff ü•≤ What&rsquo;s next, in 2025? I‚Ä¶ I really think I need to work a bit more on work-life balance (sideproject-life balance?) this year. I feel like I&rsquo;m doing way too many things. But I have no idea if that&rsquo;s going to happen. I think at least I should try to do a bit more project finishing and a bit less project starting.</p>
<p>First of all, I can&rsquo;t wait to get out of this transitional state with that main service running on three different databases in parallel. I think I&rsquo;m really close now (though I&rsquo;ve been saying this for weeks).</p>
<p>Then, I have all of the above to maintain, OAuth to add to Minisky &amp; Skythread, things like better documentation and tests to add to the open source projects. I have a few ideas for longer blog posts to write, e.g. some kind of architectural introduction to ATProto.</p>
<p>And also‚Ä¶ I&rsquo;d really love to write an <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#app-view">AppView</a> one day (but yes, I know, less project starting üòõ).</p>

			 <p>I think I&rsquo;ve finally made some good progress with my Postgres database. Things are working pretty well now, and I still have a few fixes in the queue. It&rsquo;s not all finished yet, but I feel like I&rsquo;m coming out of the woods now.</p>
<p>For those out of the loop: I have a server which streams and saves all posts from the Bluesky firehose, and uses this data to run several feeds on Bluesky used by 1k+ people, plus generates daily post statistics, the directory of custom handles and things like that.</p>
<p>This all has been running on SQLite so far (200+ GB file now), and it has served me well far longer than I would ever have expected, but in the end I&rsquo;m hitting its limits. The main problem is lack of support for concurrent writes, which makes it unrealistic to e.g. split the work into multiple workers, which I&rsquo;m gonna have to do sooner or later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only really used MySQL before on servers, but everyone was telling me I need to use Postgres, so I did what any normal person would have done (right?): I&rsquo;ve set up two test servers, one on MySQL and one on Postgres, running from two modified branches of the code, and I made the SQLite-based production server proxy some requests to one or the other in order to test them on real traffic. A sort of database A/B testing ü§™</p>
<p>It has been working like this for a few months now, and I&rsquo;ve been slowly tweaking things, mostly on the Postgres side. Since I got it to work at all, they&rsquo;ve both been working ok, but MySQL has generally been doing more write I/O doing the same things, and Postgres has been doing comparably more read I/O.</p>
<p>The key part are the Replies feeds (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr/feed/follows-replies">Follows &amp; Replies</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr/feed/replies">Only Replies</a>, it&rsquo;s basically the same code). These two are kind of variants of the built-in Following feed, showing the connecting user their own chronological timeline, generated live, filtered in some way. These feeds work by fetching the requesting user&rsquo;s follows list, either from the AppView or from a local cache, and then making a query that&rsquo;s basically: <em>&ldquo;give me the most recent 100 posts from any of these 50/200/1000/5000 users&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>There are two relevant indexes in that table: one on <code>(repo, time)</code> (repo = user&rsquo;s DID), and one on just <code>(time)</code>. Roughly speaking, for those users who follow e.g. 80 or 200 people, it makes more sense to scan the <code>(repo, time)</code> index those 80-200 times and collect the 100 most recent posts from all of those found, and for those who follow e.g. 9000 (yes, that happens üòõ), it&rsquo;s faster to scan the single <code>(time)</code> index until you find 100 relevant posts. But I&rsquo;ve been struggling to make Postgres always use the right index.</p>
<p>At first it tried to use the <code>(time)</code> index way too much. I tried to find a way to force it to use a specific index, but I was told it&rsquo;s not possible (<a href="https://pg-hint-plan.readthedocs.io">it might be though!</a>). With the help of some people on Bluesky, I managed to rewrite the query to use the other index, but then it worked bad for those people with a lot of follows. I interpreted the EXPLAINs as the query planner not having a good enough info about the structure of the data (it estimated <code>n_distinct</code>, the total number of distinct values in a column, as much lower than the actual number of users in the table), so I started messing with the &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; settings. I ended up bumping up the statistics target to the maximum 10,000 (making ANALYZE take really long) and hardcoded <code>n_distinct</code> to 4.5M, which was closer to the total count. I also increased <code>shared_buffers</code> to 1 GB. This improved things somewhat, to the &ldquo;not great, not terrible&rdquo; level, but I was still not happy with the performance.</p>
<p>But eventually, I was able to improve things a lot over the last few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, I was re-reading one of the blog posts about the differences in how MySQL and Postgres organize data internally, and I had a bit of an epiphany: unlike MySQL, Postgres doesn&rsquo;t store the primary key (<code>id</code>) in secondary indexes, since they reference the physical location of the data instead. In MySQL I had a version of the query which first did a subquery that collected just post IDs, and then used the final 100 IDs to fetch posts, but this couldn&rsquo;t work here if the indexes don&rsquo;t include <code>id</code>! This was something unexpected for me. So I replaced the larger index with <code>(repo, time DESC, id)</code> and rewrote the query again with a subquery, and the EXPLAIN showed &ldquo;Index Only Scan&rdquo; now, meaning it could use just the index for the subquery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, the Index Only Scan was showing something like: &ldquo;Heap Fetches: 31362&rdquo;. This apparently means that even though it tries to only use the index in that step, it still has to go fetch 30k post rows from the actual table. This is because as records are updated or deleted (in my case only really deleted), Postgres just marks them as deleted, but doesn&rsquo;t free up the space or update the index until a VACUUM is done. A separate structure called &ldquo;visibility map&rdquo; tracks which table pages have some outdated records in them, and if an index entry points to such page, it has to go check if that record is still there. So I started <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr/post/3lfg76issfc2c">tracking the state</a> of this visibility map, and set up a cron job to do the VACUUM twice a day to keep it relatively &ldquo;clean&rdquo;. (I wish it was as easy to do with my apartment‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>Now, it was working great for people with short lists, but still tried to use the <code>(repo, time, id)</code> index for most very long lists. The EXPLAIN showed that it was vastly overestimating the cost of using <code>(time)</code>. I came to the conclusion that‚Ä¶ the hardcoded <code>n_distinct</code> was actually working against it now, even though it was technically more precise. In my practical use cases, what actually matters is not how many different users have at least one post anywhere in the table, but how many are <em>actively posting</em> - whose posts you can find in the last few hours or a day. And that&rsquo;s much less than 4.5M. So I cleared the hardcoded <code>n_distinct</code> and let it find its own estimate, and reset the statistics target to the default 100 - and this improved things quite a bit! It was now almost perfectly using <code>index_posts_on_repo_time_id</code> to around ~1200 followed accounts, and <code>index_posts_on_time</code> above that.</p>

<li>
<p>Not related to the query/Postgres directly, but I also added a &ldquo;prefetching&rdquo; task to the follows list cache: it runs every 15 minutes and checks which follows lists are approaching the point where the cached data becomes stale (but was accessed recently) and reloads the list from the AppView in advance. This saves a couple to several seconds of time every time the list had to be refreshed before returning the feed, so it made quite a lot of difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One last thing I need to fix is that for long lists, significant time is spent on query planning (e.g. 1724 ms planning time and then 12 ms execution time). I&rsquo;m gonna try to restructure the query to pass the list of user IDs differently somehow and see if that helps, or perhaps I could move the cache to a new database table instead of keeping it in .json files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, I have some more config tweaking to do - e.g. it seems <code>shared_buffers</code> could be bumped up to at least 2 GB here (with 8 GB total RAM) - but I wanted to first make sure it&rsquo;s doing the right things before I give it more space to cache it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to when I can finally set up a production instance with Postgres and move everything there and drop the other branches - but I feel like this moment is getting close üòÖ</p>
