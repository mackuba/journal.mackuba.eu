I can&rsquo;t count the number of Apple devices I tried out and sent back, because something wasn&rsquo;t right. Because there are always tradeoffs, and I don&rsquo;t like tradeoffs, I want it to be just perfect 😅</p>\n<p>So since I really needed a new MacBook (I&rsquo;ve been using an M1, which would be fine if I had only bought it with more than 8 GB RAM… 🤦🏻‍♂️), last autumn I decided to test MacBooks this way. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I wanted an Air or a Pro, since they&rsquo;re quite different right now. There&rsquo;s this <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/apples-extended-return-policy-2024/\">holiday promotion</a> that Apple has each year around Black Friday, that if you buy something in November-December, you can safely return it until the 2nd week of January (!) instead of the usual 2-week period. So I decided to buy both an M3 13&quot; Air and an M4 14&quot; Pro, try them out and keep one in January 🙃</p>\n<p>Spoiler: I&rsquo;ve kept the Air in the end. The Pro has some things better than the Air, but it&rsquo;s noticeably thicker and heavier, and using the classic MacBook Airs for ~5 years in the last decade has spoiled me forever, and I just refuse to go back to heavier, bulkier laptops.</p>\n<p>There are a few more differences that I wrote down, so here&rsquo;s a short subjective comparison if you&rsquo;re just looking at those shiny new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/\">Sky Blue Airs</a> and thinking if you should get that one or the Pro…</p>\n<p>Note: I haven&rsquo;t really used the Pro that much, certainly not all the time for 2 months - more like a few times for a few hours. I&rsquo;m writing on the Air right now.</p>\n<h3 id=\"screen\">Screen</h3>\n<p>The Pro has a slightly bigger screen, not that much though.</p>\n<p><strong>ProMotion</strong> (120 Hz) on Pro is immediately noticeable, but I can&rsquo;t say if it&rsquo;s important or even clearly better, it&rsquo;s a bit weird at first (feels kinda… iOS-y?); probably something I could get used to rather quickly though. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m missing it on the Air at all, but I&rsquo;m not <em>that</em> used to this mode, since the only devices with it that I owned was my previous and current iPad.</p>\n<p>The Pro has a better <strong>DPI</strong> - the screen has a &ldquo;full 2x Retina&rdquo; resolution (1512 x 982 &ldquo;point&rdquo; size), while the Air uses a scaled resolution (1280 x 832 &ldquo;point&rdquo; size, while the standard display resolution is 1470 x 956), so the Pro&rsquo;s screen is sharper. Again, the past two MacBooks I&rsquo;ve used also used the scaled resolution, so it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s bothering me.</p>\n<p>Pro has an <strong>HDR mode</strong> with higher brightness - I&rsquo;ve tested this playing &ldquo;Silo&rdquo; on Apple TV, but… I had a bit mixed feelings about it.

But note the &ldquo;outdoor&rdquo; - so it&rsquo;s something that uses the light sensor, and only enables higher max limit if it&rsquo;s bright. So if you took both of them outside on a bright day, the Pro would probably be much more usable, but in a rather dark room, they looked pretty much the same at max brightness. But there might be some hacks to unlock the limit (?). Anyway, as someone who usually has max brightness set, and has sent back one Air in the past because it was too dark (400 nits), the current Air is good enough for me.</p>\n<p>I was a bit worried about the screen <strong>color balance</strong> - Apple has this annoying thing where every device has a <em>slightly</em> different white tone, sometimes it&rsquo;s more yellowish, sometimes more blueish, sometimes more towards violet…. and it&rsquo;s not always possible/easy to calibrate it differently.

But they can be calibrated a bit - the Pro has this more advanced color calibration thingie that I&rsquo;ve never seen before, that&rsquo;s missing on the Air, which lets you change color balance on a hexagonal grid. The Air has a standard color profile wizard with a white point slider.

I… I really think I need to work a bit more on work-life balance (sideproject-life balance?) this year. I feel like I&rsquo;m doing way too many things. But I have no idea if that&rsquo;s going to happen. I think at least I should try to do a bit more project finishing and a bit less project starting.</p>\n<p>First of all, I can&rsquo;t wait to get out of this transitional state with that main service running on three different databases in parallel. I think I&rsquo;m really close now (though I&rsquo;ve been saying this for weeks).</p>\n<p>Then, I have all of the above to maintain, OAuth to add to Minisky &amp; Skythread, things like better documentation and tests to add to the open source projects. I have a few ideas for longer blog posts to write, e.g. some kind of architectural introduction to ATProto.</p>\n<p>And also… I&rsquo;d really love to write an <a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#app-view\">AppView</a> one day (but yes, I know, less project starting 😛).</p>\n",

I also periodically post stats of [most popular languages on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3lge5635azs2g) – what % of posts are in which language, and how many users are there that regularly post in each\n* The very unstyled [labellers list page](https://blue.mackuba.eu/labellers/), which was even briefly featured in a [CNBC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbk1QyS0B_0&t=625s) for a few seconds 🤯\n* An automatically updating list of official [.gov](https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/lists/3lcq5ovmsjn2s) and [.edu](https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/lists/3lcq7vydkgi27) accounts with verified handles, plus an open source repo with the [script that updates them](https://github.com/mackuba/userlist_sync)\n* I also managed to learn some basics of Rust 🦀 and to write – with major help from ChatGPT – a tiny native module for Ruby in Rust, which I knew absolutely nothing about before, to speed up the matching of post contents to regexps (I'll try to write a bit more about this at some point and share the code)\n* … and I've spent literally months working on migrating this whole thing from SQLite to [either MySQL or Postgres](https://journal.mackuba.eu/2025/01/16/postgress-progress/), and I'm still not done 😩\n\n### [Skythread](https://github.com/mackuba/skythread)\n\n* Added a hashtag feed view, listing latest posts with the given hashtag, back when this wasn't working in the Bluesky app yet\n* Similarly, added a post quotes counter and a view listing the post quotes, before that was added to the app (you can still use it now to peek at the quotes which are hidden/detached in the official app 😈)\n* Implemented link highlighting and link cards\n* Added special handling for bridged Mastodon posts, which are showing author's formatted Mastodon handle and the expanded full-length post contents (since Bridgy [stashes the full original text](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1092#issuecomment-2164027121) in a custom field in the post records)\n* Added an \"[infohazard](https://bsky.app/profile/mackuba.eu/post/3kxg32sjqi22x)\" feature, which lets you load hidden comments which the official app hides because of the \"nuclear block\" between two commenters\n\nSome of these, like the quotes list and the hidden comments, use data loaded from the Bluefeeds server APIs – since I'm saving all incoming posts to one big-ass table, I can index them by quote source and by thread root, and can use that to look up all quotes of a post or all replies which are supposed to be there in the thread.\n\n### Blog\n\n* I wrote a super long post \"[Complete guide to Bluesky](https://mackuba.eu/2024/02/21/bluesky-guide/)\" with a lot of explanations of how things work and various tips and tricks (and updated it a few times, as new features were added)\n\n### [Skyfall](https://github.com/mackuba/skyfall)\n\n* 7 releases, adding support for new features like labellers or account state events\n* added support for streaming from [Jetstream](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream), parsing events from JSON instead of CBOR\n\n### [Minisky](https://github.com/mackuba/minisky)\n\n* 2 releases with small improvements (OAuth support is still waiting for a better day)\n\n### New projects & tools\n\n* [Label Scanner](https://blue.mackuba.eu/scanner/) – a simple web tool that shows all labels assigned to an account/post by any of the known labellers\n* [sdk.blue](https://sdk.blue) – list of libraries and SDKs for Bluesky/ATProto, grouped by language\n* [tootify](https://github.com/mackuba/tootify) – a simple tool for selective cross-posting from Bluesky to Mastodon, which I use to mirror some of my Bluesky posts to my [Mastodon account](https://martianbase.net/@mackuba)\n* [didkit](https://github.com/mackuba/didkit) – a Ruby library for resolving handles to DIDs, loading DID info like assigned PDS host etc.\n* a [bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/mackuba/e7e865dfbc0d978a2ac21d02566b2e8f) to easily mute notifications in the Bluesky web app\n* two Ruby scripts to scan [your home feed](https://gist.github.com/mackuba/711764ea0bfd058610cc203a6a3f834f) or [some selected accounts](https://gist.github.com/mackuba/99110c07736570c02220038c1b716817) and print the stats of who is posting how much daily\n\n### Servers\n\n* I've migrated my projects from my old Swiss hosting [Coin.host](https://coin.host) to German [Netcup](https://www.netcup.com/en), which has VPSes with *really* fast CPUs and SSDs and a ton of bandwidth included for a really good price\n* I've set up my own self-hosted PDS at **lab.martianbase.net**, and [migrated](https://internect.info/did/did:plc:oio4hkxaop4ao4wz2pp3f4cr) my main account there\n\n---\n\nOof… that's a lot of stuff 🥲 What's next, in 2025? I… I really think I need to work a bit more on work-life balance (sideproject-life balance?) this year. I feel like I'm doing way too many things. But I have no idea if that's going to happen. I think at least I should try to do a bit more project finishing and a bit less project starting.\n\nFirst of all, I can't wait to get out of this transitional state with that main service running on three different databases in parallel. I think I'm really close now (though I've been saying this for weeks).\n\nThen, I have all of the above to maintain, OAuth to add to Minisky & Skythread, things like better documentation and tests to add to the open source projects. I have a few ideas for longer blog posts to write, e.g. some kind of architectural introduction to ATProto.\n\nAnd also… I'd really love to write an [AppView](https://atproto.com/guides/glossary#app-view) one day (but yes, I know, less project starting 😛).\n",

These two are kind of variants of the built-in Following feed, showing the connecting user their own chronological timeline, generated live, filtered in some way. These feeds work by fetching the requesting user&rsquo;s follows list, either from the AppView or from a local cache, and then making a query that&rsquo;s basically: <em>&ldquo;give me the most recent 100 posts from any of these 50/200/1000/5000 users&rdquo;</em>.</p>\n<p>There are two relevant indexes in that table: one on <code>(repo, time)</code> (repo = user&rsquo;s DID), and one on just <code>(time)</code>. Roughly speaking, for those users who follow e.g. 80 or 200 people, it makes more sense to scan the <code>(repo, time)</code> index those 80-200 times and collect the 100 most recent posts from all of those found, and for those who follow e.g. 9000 (yes, that happens 😛), it&rsquo;s faster to scan the single <code>(time)</code> index until you find 100 relevant posts.

With the help of some people on Bluesky, I managed to rewrite the query to use the other index, but then it worked bad for those people with a lot of follows. I interpreted the EXPLAINs as the query planner not having a good enough info about the structure of the data (it estimated <code>n_distinct</code>, the total number of distinct values in a column, as much lower than the actual number of users in the table), so I started messing with the &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; settings. I ended up bumping up the statistics target to the maximum 10,000 (making ANALYZE take really long) and hardcoded <code>n_distinct</code> to 4.5M, which was closer to the total count. I also increased <code>shared_buffers</code> to 1 GB. This improved things somewhat, to the &ldquo;not great, not terrible&rdquo; level, but I was still not happy with the performance.</p>\n<p>But eventually, I was able to improve things a lot over the last few weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First, I was re-reading one of the blog posts about the differences in how MySQL and Postgres organize data internally, and I had a bit of an epiphany: unlike MySQL, Postgres doesn&rsquo;t store the primary key (<code>id</code>) in secondary indexes, since they reference the physical location of the data instead. In MySQL I had a version of the query which first did a subquery that collected just post IDs, and then used the final 100 IDs to fetch posts, but this couldn&rsquo;t work here if the indexes don&rsquo;t include <code>id</code>! This was something unexpected for me. So I replaced the larger index with <code>(repo, time DESC, id)</code> and rewrote the query again with a subquery, and the EXPLAIN showed &ldquo;Index Only Scan&rdquo; now, meaning it could use just the index for the subquery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Next, the Index Only Scan was showing something like: &ldquo;Heap Fetches: 31362&rdquo;.

This is because as records are updated or deleted (in my case only really deleted), Postgres just marks them as deleted, but doesn&rsquo;t free up the space or update the index until a VACUUM is done.

So I cleared the hardcoded <code>n_distinct</code> and let it find its own estimate, and reset the statistics target to the default 100 - and this improved things quite a bit!
